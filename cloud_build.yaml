# The file is named differently than the default because the app needs to be deployed
# using the custom Dockerfile, but there's no way to easily do that and then trigger
# an automatic deployment that I could find. But, you can rename this cloudbuild.yaml
# file and then use this configuration to trigger the Docker build. Seems to work.
